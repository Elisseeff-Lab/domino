\arguments{
\item{dom}{Domino object that has undergone network building with \code{\link[=build_domino]{build_domino()}}}

\item{receptor}{Name of a receptor active in at least one cell type in the domino object}

\item{ligand}{Name of a ligand active in at least one cell type in the domino object}

\item{expression_threshold}{Minimum mean expression value of a ligand by a cell type for a chord to be rendered between the cell type and the receptor}

\item{cell_idents}{Vector of cell types from cluster assignments in the domino object to be included in the plot.}

\item{cell_colors}{Named vector of color names or hex codes where names correspond to the plotted cell types and the color values}

\item{title}{if provided, final title will be paste0(receptor/ligand, " Signaling")}

\item{label_arcs}{logical indicating if arc populations should be labeled}

\item{multi_plot}{numeric vector that, if present indicates which plot in a list of plots this one is (for legend output)}

\value{
renders a circos plot to the active graphics device
}
\description{
Creates a chord plot of expression of ligands that can activate a specified
receptor where chord widths correspond to mean ligand expression by the cluster.
