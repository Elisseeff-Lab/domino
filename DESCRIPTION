Description: 
    dominoSignal is a package developed to analyze cell signaling through ligand - receptor - transcription factor networks in scRNAseq data. It takes as input information transcriptomic data, requiring counts, z-scored counts, and cluster labels, as well as information on transcription factor activation (such as from SCENIC) and a database of ligand and receptor pairings (such as from cellphoneDB). This package creates an object storing ligand - receptor - transcription factor linkages by cluster and provides several methods for exploring, summarizing, and visualizing the analysis.
